# Face-recognition



In the first module we have  installed python from the website and then In second module we installed and imported necessary libraries such as  OpenCv, Face Recognition, Numpy, Cmake, Flask, certify, chardet, idna, moviepy, imageio, numpy, pillow, requests, gevent, harscade then 

In the third module, we have divide the coding part into three phase , In phase -1 face detection and data gathering. You must capture a face in order to recognize it. The most common way to detect a face (or any objects),is using the “Haar Cascade classifier” – effective face detection method. The algorithm needs a lot of positive images (images of faces) and negative images (images without faces) to train the classifier. Then we need to extract features from it. Data Gathering : After Face detection, multiple Captured face images are stored in a dataset folder.

In the fourth module (Phase 2) we trained the model using LBHP Algorithm and In module five (Phase 3) we tested the system using different faces, to check accuracy and whether the system can able to recognize the person.
